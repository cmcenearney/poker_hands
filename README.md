Poker Hands
===========

This is a Java 8 solution to the [Project Euler poker problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=54).
 
The goal is to explore new features, particularly lambdas, and implement something akin to the Strategy pattern.

The `exp` branch is experimental :-)  Playing around with lambdas and friends.
