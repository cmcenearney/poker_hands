Poker Hands
===========

This is a Java 8 solution to the [Project Euler poker problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=54).
 
The goal is to explore new features, particularly lambdas, and implement something akin to the Strategy pattern.

The `class_for_every_hand` branch attempts to use Strategy in the classic sense

On the `master` branch I'm playing around with ways to modify the classic approach using some of the new features in Java 8
